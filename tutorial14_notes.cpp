// In this tutorial we will learn about inheritance in C++.
// It is a very important topic and a bit complicated.
// It is used for reusability which is very important for C++.

// Let's say we have a class Employee. And now we need a class
// called Programmer. Now, programmer is an employee so we need all
// the members of Employee. We use inheritance here.

// Existing class is called Base class and the inheriting class 
// is called Derived Class.

// For a derived class, we can have multiple base classes.

// Types of inheritences - 
// 1. Single Inheritences
// 2. Multiple Inheritences
// 3. Hierarchical Inheritences
// 4. Multilevel Inheritences
// 5. Hybrid Inheritences

// * Single Inheritence - A derived class from a single base class.
// * Multiple Inheritence - A derived class with more than one base classes.
// * Hierarchical Inheritence - Several derived classes from a single base class.
// * Multilevel Inheritence - Deriving a class from a derived class. For example -
                // Animal --> Mammal (Animal + More) --> Cow (Mammal + More)
// * Hybrid Inheritence - A combination of all above. For example -
        // Animal --> (Mammal and Bird) --> Bat
